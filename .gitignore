# Compiled JavaScript files from TypeScript (only in directories with TypeScript files)
# Note: This is a workaround since we can't use conditional ignores
# To properly exclude compiled TypeScript, run: git rm <file>.js after compiling
# Or keep compiled JS files in a separate build/ directory
*.js.map

# Build outputs (uncomment if using a build directory)
# dist/
# build/

# Node modules
node_modules/

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Ignore testTest folder
testTest/
testTest/test.ts
