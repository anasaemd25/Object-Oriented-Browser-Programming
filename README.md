# Object-Oriented Browser Programming — Coursework

Personal repository for the coursework in Object-Oriented Browser Programming. This is where I keep my notes, exercises, assignments, and small experiments in JavaScript/TypeScript that run in the browser and manipulate the DOM.

## Why this repo exists
- Practice OOP in JavaScript (classes, encapsulation, inheritance, composition)
- Use basic functional programming in JS (map/filter/reduce, pure functions)
- Build browser apps that interact with the DOM and handle events
- Try TypeScript alongside JS to improve types and tooling

## What I already know (prereqs)
- Variables
- Control flow (if/switch, loops)
- Functions

## What I’m learning here
- OOP: classes, methods, visibility, encapsulation, interfaces, inheritance vs. composition
- FP basics: higher‑order functions, immutability basics, pure functions
- Browser + DOM: querying, events, rendering, forms, fetch
- TypeScript: gradual typing for browser/OOP code

## Tech stack and tools
- JavaScript (ES6+) and TypeScript
- HTML/CSS, DOM APIs, Fetch API
- VS Code + extensions: ESLint, Prettier, Live Server
- Optional: Node.js + npm for dev tooling

## Repository structure (subject to change)
I create one folder per lesson (lesson1, lesson2, lesson3, …). Inside each lesson folder:
- I keep only JavaScript files where I code along with the teacher during class. This lets me practice while they code and review the same examples later.
- If that week has extra practice, I add an `exercises/` subfolder inside the same lesson folder.

Example:
```
lesson3/
  calculator.js
  dom-events.js
  exercises/
    todo-practice.js
```

## My goals
- Design small programs with OOP principles (favor composition; use inheritance when it fits)
- Use FP utilities (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) for data transformations
- Manipulate the DOM safely and clearly (events, state, rendering)
- Add TypeScript types to reduce runtime errors

## Progress checklist
- Set up project and dev server
- OOP basics: classes, methods, encapsulation
- Inheritance vs. composition exercise
- FP basics: map/filter/reduce practice
- DOM events + rendering mini‑app
- Fetch + async handling
- Add TypeScript to one module
- Final assignment

## How I work
- Commit with clear messages
- Use branches for bigger tasks
- Keep code formatted (Prettier) and linted (ESLint)
- Add short notes in `docs/` for decisions or gotchas

## Personal targets (based on course assessment levels)
- Satisfactory (1): Complete tasks with guidance, use core concepts
- Good (3): Justify choices, analyze problems, work constructively in a team
- Excellent (5): Connect concepts to real use cases, solve creatively, reflect and improve
